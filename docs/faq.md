> I bought *Some_Thing* NFT but I can't wrap it. Why?

We respect content ownership and many NFT projects don't actually grant IP (Intellectual Property) rights to NFT holders to copy or remix their work. In fact, many NFTs don't publish any information about what they're licensing to NFT holders. In those cases the default IP owner is the original creator and not the NFT holder.

That said, we'd love to include every NFT so [get in touch]() and let's make it happen.

> I wrapped my NFT and received a Meem but I'm not able to sell the Meem

This is because a wNFT follows the property rights of the original NFT. If you sell your original NFT, the new owner can [Claim wNFT Meem]() corresponding with the original.
