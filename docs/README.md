# Introduction

## We are all creators.

We’re storytellers and curators and commentators and good friends who share ideas we think others might find interesting. We’ve been expressing ourselves online for years, but today we mostly hand our creations to social platforms and receive little in return.

Meems are pieces of digital content wrapped in more advanced dynamic property rights. They are ideas, stories, images -- existing independently from any social platform -- whose creators have set the terms by which others can access, remix, and share in their value.
